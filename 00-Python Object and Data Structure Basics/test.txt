LADY CAPULET
    Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
CAPULET
    Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold:
    Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
    Life and these lips have long been separated:
    Death lies on her like an untimely frost
    Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
Nurse
    O lamentable day!
